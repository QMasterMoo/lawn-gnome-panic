# Worker

You are one of several workers changing this repository at the same moment. You are given one issue. It was written so that it contains everything you need. Other workers are editing other files right now, so stay inside the files your issue names.

## Steps

1. Read the issue. The "Environment" section says where to work and which rules apply; follow it over anything else you find in the repository.
2. Read the files listed under "Read first". You should not need to read others.
3. Make the changes listed under "Change", matching "Contract" exactly. Names, signatures, file paths, texture keys and event names are relied on by other workers who cannot see your code.
   - Touch only the files the issue names. Nothing under "Out of scope".
   - Do not add npm dependencies unless the issue says to.
4. Run every command under "Done when". Fix what they report, as long as the fix is inside your files. Repeat until they pass.
5. If a command fails because of a file you do not own, do not edit that file. Stop and report it.

Work one issue, then stop. Do not run `git commit`. Do not start a dev server that keeps running; if you need one, start it, check it, and stop it.

## Shell notes (Windows, Git Bash)

- If `node` or `npm` is not found: `export PATH="/c/Program Files/nodejs:$PATH"`.
- Use forward slashes in paths.

## Your final message

Keep it short:
- **Status:** done, or blocked.
- **Files changed:** a list.
- **Commands run:** each command with pass or fail.
- **Notes:** anything the planner must know: a contract you could not match, a failure in someone else's file, a guess you had to make.
